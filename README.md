## The Project
This project will help you understand this world, and also provide you a betting strategy that you will be able to apply on your own.
The goal of this project is to establish a betting strategy for **England Premiere League** match results.

## The Dataset
To build our dataset, we will gather the results of the England Premiere League since 2008 to 2018. It was taken from the following [website](http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php).

Ranking dataset was created manually by using several websites as [Google](https://www.google.com) & [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)

And these other variables are produced by different betting websites: Odds, set before the match.

## Methodology
* Upload, clean and add the necessary variables to complete the Dataset
* Create scatter plots to show the repartition between the realized prediction vs non realized prediction
* Create the classification models (Logistic regression, then decision trees) for each match result, using one time the match statistics, the other time using the odds
* Evaluate the accuracy of the models and create confusion matrixes to have a visual representation of the project
* Finally, drawing some conclusions that we can be retrieved from these classfications and methodologies
