## The Project
You do not know anything about sports betting or you want to implement a new strategy? This project will help you understand this world, and also provide you a betting strategy that you will be able to apply on your own.

The goal of this project is to establish a betting strategy for **England Premiere League** match results.

## The Dataset
To build our dataset, we will gather the results of the England Premiere League since 2008 to 2018. It was taken from the following [website](http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php).

Some features to this dataset, taken from this website:

## The Variables
All the variables are linked to the matche: 
* match's ID
* Match's date time
* Home team
* Away team
* Final number of goals
* Match result (Home Team win, Away Team win or Draw Match)
* Team's ranking of the previous Football season (static rank at the end of the past season)
* Referee for the match
* Number of shots
* Number of fouls

And the other variables are not directly linked to the match statistics.
These other variables are the
* Odds set before the match by different betting websites. These odds are set on the final result of a match (Home Team win, Away Team win, Draw Match).
