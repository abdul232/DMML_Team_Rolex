# DMML_Team_Rolex

You do not know anything about sports betting or you want to implement a new strategy? This project will help you understand this world, and also provide you a betting strategy that you will be able to apply on your own.

## The Project
The goal of this project is to establish a betting strategy for **England Premiere League** match results.

## The Dataset
To build our dataset, we will gather the results of the England Premiere League since 2008 to 2018. It was taken from the following [website](http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php).

Some features to this dataset, taken from this website:

## The Variables
All the variables are linked to the matche: **match's ID**, the match's **date time**, the **Home team**, the **Away team**, the **final number of goals**, the **match result** (Home Team win, Away Team win or Draw Match), the **team's ranking** of the previous Football season (static rank at the end of the past season), the **referee** for the match, the **number of shots**, the **number of fouls**, and the other variables are not directly linked to the match statistics. These other variables are the **odds set before the match** by different betting websites. These odds are set on the **final result** of a match (Home Team win, Away Team win, Draw Match).
