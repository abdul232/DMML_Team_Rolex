    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> You do not know anything about sports betting or you want to implement a new strategy? This notebook will help you understand this world, and also provide you a **betting strategy** that you will be able to apply on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we will take the example of Football, one of the sports with the highest number of bets. More precisely, we will concentrate on **England Premiere League match results**, because its great number of matches will allow us to test and build a strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanations on betting's vocabulary\n",
    "First, let's set up the vocabulary. While betting,  _odds_ are linked to each bet you make. Betting odds tell you how likely an event is to happen, and represents how much money you could win if your bet realizes itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, you are on a betting website. If the odd is set as 1.40 for \"Home team win\" and you put 10€ on this odd, if the Home team actually wins (so your prediction realizes itself), you will earn 4€ and get back your first 10€.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is the possibility to bet on different type of results before a match. Here, we will take into account the bets on the match result (Home team wins, Away team wins, Draw match).\n"

    "## II. Dataset & Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we chose groups the results of the English Premier League matches **from 2008 to 2019**. It was taken from the following website:\n",
    "We also added some features to this dataset, taken from this website:\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables available are about the matches: the match's **ID**, the match's **date time**, the **Home team**, the **Away team**, the final **number of goals**, the **match result** (Home Team win, Away Team win or Draw Match), the **team's ranking** of the previous Football season (static rank at the end of the past season), the **referee** for the match, the number of **shots**, the number of **fouls**, and the other variables are not directly linked to the match statistics. These other variables are **the odds set before the match** by **different betting websites**. These odds are set on the **final result** of a match (Home Team win, Away Team win, Draw Match).\n",
    "\n",
    "## III. Goal of the project & models\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to build a model that can predict the following output : Home Team win, Away Team win or Draw match.\n",
    "Of course, the model will not predict perfectly the output, but by knowing which match result have the most chances to happen can create some winning bets. This will be done through **Classifications** models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to build two models, taking into acount different independant variables: \n",
    "- One time, we will try to predict a match result based on the **betting websites' predictions**, that can be seen **through the odds** websites put on the possible result. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Another time we will use the **Match Statistics**, with the rank of each team, the number of shots/fouls, the number of goals, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to obtain these predictions, we will also try two classifications models: **Descision Trees** and **Logistic Regressions**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> In the end, we will evaluate the relevance of each classification model, and also define **which independant variables** (Odds or Statitics of the Match) **explained the best the Match Result**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IV. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At first, we will import the packages that we will need during this analyse.\n",
    "2. Then, we will upload, clean and add the necessary variables to complete the Dataset.\n",
    "3. Some variables will be transformed the variables in a way we can use them properly.\n",
    "4. Following this point, we will create scatter plots to show the repartition between the realized prediction vs non realized prediction. (When the match Odd is set on Home win => 0 the match result is Home did not win, 1 when Home won) \n",
    "5. Consequently, we will create the classification models (Logistic regression, then decision trees). It will be done for each match result, using one time the match statistics, the other time using the odds. \n",
    "6. We will also evaluate the accuracy of the models and create confusion matrixes to have a visual representation of the project.\n",
    "7. Finally, we will draw some conclusions that we can be retrieved from these classfications and methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will also analyse our models and try to tink about how we could improve them and how they could be useful for business.\n"
